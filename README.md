# Weather-Dashboard - Challenge Module 6

Description 

The weather dashboard is intended for users to lookup the weather forecast for cities in the US so that they can plan their trip accordingly. The OpenWeather API was used to gather the coordinates of the searched city which was then utilized to search up the weather forecast. When searching for a city, the user will be presented with both the current and future forecast. 

- Information that will be displayed in the current weather box will include:

    - city name
    - date
    - an icon which represents the current weather condition
    - temperature 
    - humidity
    - wind speed 
    - uv index
 
 The data presented in the 5-day forecast will be similar to the current weather box but with less information. Upon searching a city, that city will then be added to the search history, allowing the user to go back and forth between recent searches. When the user reopens the application, all the cities that were searched in the previous session will be displayed in the search history.

 This application was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js.
